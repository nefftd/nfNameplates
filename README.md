nfNameplates
============

A simple nameplate replacement for World of Warcraft.


Configuration
-------------

There is no configuration proper. If you want a configurable WoW nameplate addon, there are several good ones.

The look and behavior of the nameplates has been cleanly separated from the core functionality, in `ui.lua`. Anyone experienced with Lua may therefore "configure" this addon by forking it, and tweaking or rewriting `ui.lua` to their desire. The existing `ui.lua` is generously formatted, and includes several necessary comments to get started writing your own.
