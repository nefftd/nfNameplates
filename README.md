nfNameplates
============

A nameplate replacement for World of Warcraft. It's very simple right now, and merely a stylistic departure from the default nameplates. But in the coming months before WoD, I plan to implement many additional features people have come to love from bigger nameplate addons, with a big emphasis on efficiency, as well as some original ideas of my own. 


Configuration
-------------

There is no configuration proper. If you want a nameplate addon with a good in-game configuration, there are several good ones.

The look and behavior of the nameplates has been cleanly separated from the core functionality, in `ui.lua`. Anyone experienced with Lua may therefore "configure" this addon by forking it, and tweaking or rewriting `ui.lua` to their desire. The existing `ui.lua` is generously formatted, and includes several necessary comments to get started writing your own.
